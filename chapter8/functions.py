# A function is a group of statements performing a specific task.

# When a program gets bigger in size and its complexity grows, it gets difficult for a programmer to keep track of which piece of code is doing what!

# A function can be reused by the programmer in a given program any number of times.

# There are two types of function in python:
#     1. Built in function
#     2. User defined function
