# A class method is a method which is bound to the class and 
# not the object of the class.

# @classmethod decorator is used to create a class method.

#IF we want to change class attribute directly not creating 
# any instance attribute then we can use class method.

    #     self.__class__.salary = sal # It is one method.
        # Dunder or magic methods in Python are the methods
        # having two prefix and suffix underscores in the method name. 
        # Dunder here means â€œDouble Under
