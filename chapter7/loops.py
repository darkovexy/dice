##Primarily there are two types of loops in Python

# 1.While loop
# 2.For loop

## While loop syntax

##In while loops, the condition is checked first. If it evaluates to true, the #body of the loop is executed, otherwise not!

i = 0
while(i<3):
    print(i)
    i+=1

print("Done")

## For loop syntax.
