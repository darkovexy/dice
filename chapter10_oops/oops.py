what is oops concept?
=> Object oriented programing is a programing paradigm that relies on the concept 
of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple
and reusable pieces of code blueprints(usually called classes),which are used to
create individual instances of objects.

What is class?
=> A class is an abstract blueprint used to create more specific ,concrete
objects.Classes often represents broad categories like car, dog that share attributes.
   Classses also contain functions called methods available only to objects of that type.
   
What is object?
=> An object is an instantiation of a class. When class is defined, a template(info) is defined. Memory is allocated only after object instantiation.

Objects of a given class can invoke the methods available to it without revealing the implementation details to the user.     #Abstraction & Encapsulation! 
Object is a real world entity such as pen,laptop, mobile, chair etc.
