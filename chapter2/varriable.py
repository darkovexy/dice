#In python we dont need to declare variable data types it automatically detects.
#example
a = "Old Chinmay" #in python we can write string in betn ' "" ''' 
b = 45   #python is case sensitive means A nd a both are different.
c = 78.876
d = False #in python we can write boolean values true and false.
e = None #this is a data type which means nothing.

#One more thing in python we can reasign our variable simply change the value ,#the second value given in the variable is considered as new one.
print(a)
#Now we r going to change the value of the variable a.
a = "New Chinmay who is more focused"

#printing variables
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)
print(e)

#printing data types of the variable using type keyword.
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))
print(type(e))
